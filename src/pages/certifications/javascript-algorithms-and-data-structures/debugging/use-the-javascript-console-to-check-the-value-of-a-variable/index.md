## Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable

In order to open up the Javascript Console of your Browser (chrome,firefox,safari,opera,edge) press: [here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/guide/blob/master/src/pages/certifications/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/debugging/understanding-the-differences-between-the-freecodecamp-and-browser-console/index.md)

## Hint 1:
In order to see what is the e.g. stored value of a variable we can use the command *console.log()* .
In this exercise it is required to use this command in order to display in our console the value of variable a so... How may I log into my console the value of a varible?

## Solution:
```` javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 1;
a++;
// Add your code below this line
console.log(a);

let sumAB = a + b;
console.log(sumAB);
````
